        <p>Grady Capital [LLC] is the personal investment firm of founder and owner Connor Grady. Founded in 2013, Grady Capital is a small yet aggressive assets management firm that strives for a healthy return on investment by excercising both full and partial ownership of private and public assets. By excercising this hybrid model in a disciplined and risk-controlled manner, Grady Capital has been able to establish itself in the advanced technologies market as an equity leader.</p>
        <p>The focus of Grady Capital is investments in the advanced technologies markets, including online services, cloud computing, aerospace, cellular communications, medical, and others. Companies operating in these markets represent technologies that will be a part of future societies and are, therefore, lucrative investments. By investing in their infancy, Grady Capital is able to provide much needed capital and foundation to fledgling companies and projects that will help them grow into profitable properties.</p>
